##Exercise 2

##Overview

This project is a streaming application that counts words from Tweets in real time. There are multiple technical challenges in streaming real-time data from a source as massive as Twitter. Using streaming facilities such as Apache Storm allows this seemingly humongous task to be attainable.
Despite the naturally interesting technical challenges, this architecture acts as basis of a framework with potential for amazingly impactful social and business applications. Some concrete examples include detection of cyber bullying, identification of psychopaths and early notification of natural disasters such as earthquakes.
